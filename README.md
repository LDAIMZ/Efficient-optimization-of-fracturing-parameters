# Efficient-optimization-of-fracturing-parameters
Codes for Manuscript of "Efficient optimization of fracturing parameters with consideration of fracture propagation and heterogeneity in tight gas reservoirs".The reservoir simulator used in this study is Eclipse, so users need to establish corresponding data examples according to their own needs. In this code, programs for optimizing fracture location and injection volume are provided. Among them, the fitness file includes objective function solving and Eclipse simulator calling programs. The GA file includes the parameter inputs and constraints of the genetic algorithm. The writefile file mainly includes the calculation and output process of fracture parameters.If you have any questions, contact me at 798395068@qq.com.Best wishes.
